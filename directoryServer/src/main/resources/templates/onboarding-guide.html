            <h1>EdExchange Onboarding Guide for Service Providers</h1>
            <h2 id="about-this-guide">About this Guide</h2>
            <p>
                This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the reference implementation
                of the network server to send and receive documents using EdExchange.  Upon completion of this guide, your organization
                will have become an active member of the EdExchange network and have
                successfully requested and received a PESC college transcript with Butte College based on test data and
                test student "John Doe".
            </p>

            <h2 id="join">Step 1: Join the EdExchange Network</h2>
            <p>
                To add your organization to the EdExchange directory, complete <a target="_blank" href="home#/registration-form">registration form</a>.
                Make sure to check the "Service Provider" checkbox to indicate your organization is a service provider. If your
                organization is also an institution, check the "Institution" checkbox too.
            </p>

            <h2 id="deploy-server">Step 2: Deploy a Server</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this section is to deploy an Ubuntu based Linux server that will be used to host the reference implementation
                of the EdExchange network server on the internet.   For the purpose of this guide, Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be used
                to create and deploy the server.  However,  you may optionally choose to host the server any way you like and still use this
                guide, provided the operating system is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon completion of this section, you will have a an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server that is ready
                to be provisioned with the reference implementation of the EdExchange network server.
            </p>

            <h3 id="aws-console">Step 2a: Sign In to the AWS console</h3>
            <p>
                Log into the AWS console located at <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a>.  If this link no
                longer works, do a Google search on "Amazon Web Services console" and use the search results to find the
                AWS console. Select the "Sign In To the Console" button and login.  If you don't have an Amazon account that
                is appropriate for hosting the EdExchange network server, you'll need to create an Amazon account.
            </p>
            <h3 id="open-ec2-dashboard">Step 2b: Open EC2 Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
                The server will be deployed as an EC2 instance.  There are various ways to load the EC2 console, one of which
                is to select "Services/EC2" from the main AWS dashboard (the landing page that is presented after you've logged
                into the AWS console.
            </p>
            <h3 id="create-instance">Step 2c: Create a Server Instance</h3>
            <p>
                If you've followed the instructions so far, the EC2 dashboard should be presented and you should see an option
                called "Lanuch Instance" in the "Create Instance" area of the dashboard. Select "Launch Instance" and you will
                be prompted for the required information as shown in the steps below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>


                    <b>Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</b>
                    You will be presented with several operating system choices during this part of the process.

                    You should choose the Ubuntu instance which is currently shown as "Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-7c803d1c.

                </li>
                <li>


                    <b>Choose an Instance Type</b>
                    You will be presented with several hardware options during this part of the process.
                    Select an instance type that makes sense for the amount of network traffic you
                    expect to have.  Initially, you many choose to use the free tier just to establish your
                    presence on the EdExchange network.  Later, you can change the instance type to something more
                    appropriate.

                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="start-server">Step 2d: Start the Server</h3>
            <p>
                After you've selected the operating system and instance type, select select "Review and Launch".  Review the
                information that's provided about the server instance and then select "Launch".

                Once the server is started, you'll need some way to connect to the server so that you can provision the server
                with the EdExchange software and start the network server.  AWS allows remote connections to the running server
                by use of a public/private key pair.  At this point in the process, you
                should be presented with an option to use an existing key pair (if you have already created one during a similar
                process with a different server) or to create a new pair.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may use an existing key pair if you already have one.  If you don't want
                to using existing key pair or you don't have one, select "Create a new key pair" and
                give it a name that makes sense, such as "EdExchange".

                Select "Download key pair" and save it somewhere safe and where you can easily
                access it. Note where you save it.  If you lose this file, you won't be able
                to remotely access the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you've downloaded your public/private key pair to your local system, select "Launch Instance".
                You will be presented with a page that shows the name of the new EC2 instance. For example:

            <pre>
                Your instances are now launching.
                The following instance launches have been initiated: i-0fe3dc9b47b98fb63
            </pre>

            Note the name of your new server instance, for example "i-0fe3dc9b47b98fb63" as shown above.  The
            "i-0fe3dc9b47b98fb63" should be a link, that when selected, will present the status of the instance.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, you can also find your running instances by selecting "Services/EC2" from the main AWS
                dashboard and then selecting "Running instances"
            </p>
            <p>
                Wait until the server instance is in the "Running" state before continuing to the next step.
            </p>

            <h3 id="assign-static-ip">Step 2e: Assign a Static IP Address</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this step is to allocate an static IP address that will not change whenever
                the AWS server instance is restarted.  Without this step, the AWS server instance is not
                guaranteed to have the same IP address if it's ever restarted.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the EC2 Dashboard (where you can see your running server instance under "Instance" menu item), select the
                "Elastic IPs" menu item and then select "Allocate new address" and then "Allocate".  You should be presented with
                a dialog that shows the IP address, similar to the one here:
            </p>
            <img src="assets/images/elastic-ip.png" />
            <p>Note the IP address and close the dialog.  Next, select the IP address you just created from the list of Elastic
                IP Addresses and from the Actions dropdown, select "Associate address".  Using the dialog, associate the IP address
            with your newly created server instance using the server name you noted earlier in the process. E.g. i-0fe3dc9b47b98fb63</p>

            <img src="assets/images/associate-address.png" />


            <h1 id="provision-server">Step 3: Provision the Server</h1>
            <p>
                In this section, you will provision the server with the latest EdExchange software---the reference
                implementation of the network server.  This step includes downloading the software to the AWS server
                instance and building the network server.
            </p>
            <h2 id="connect-to-server">Step 3a: Connect to the AWS Server</h2>
            <p>
                At this point in the process, you should have a running AWS server instance.  This section describes
                how to remotely connect to the running server so that you can download and build the EdExchange Network
                Server software.
            </p>
            <p>
                The method you use to connect to the running server depends on what operating system you use on your
                local host.  This is the same computer on which you saved your public/private key pair.  Amazon has
                provided instructions for each operating system...
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                <th>Your Computer</th>
                <th>How to Connect</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>

                </tbody>

            </table>
            </p>
            <p>
                The remainder of this section provides abbreviated instructions on how to connect to the server using SSH on Linux.  It assumes you used the suggested name "EdExchange" for your private key.
                If you saved the private key using a different name, substitute "EdExchange" with whatever name you used.  If the instructions here don't work for you, consult the documentation
                from Amazon in the table above.
            </p>

            <p>
            <div class="ed-title">Step 1</div>
            Using a terminal, change to the directory where you saved the private key you downloaded during the server creation process.  The file suffix should be ".pem".  If you used
            the suggested name "EdExchange" for the private key, the file will be named "EdExchange.pem".
            </p>
            <p>
            <div class="ed-title">Step 2</div>
            Use the chmod command to make sure that your private key file isn't publicly viewable. For example, if the name of your private key file is EdExchange.pem, use the following command:
            <div>
                <kbd>$ chmod 400 EdExchange.pem</kbd>
            </div>

            </p>
            <p>
            <div class="ed-title">Step 3</div>
            Obtain the public hostname of the running server.  You can get the public DNS for your instance using the Amazon
            EC2 console (check the Public DNS (IPv4) column; if this column is hidden, choose the Show/Hide icon and select Public DNS (IPv4)). An example of a typical hostname
            for a service instance in EC2 is ec2-52-32-59-26.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
            </p>
            <p>
            <div class="ed-title">Step 4</div>
            <div>
                Invoke SSH. If you saved the private key using the suggested file name "EdExchange", you can use the following command, using the public hostname of the running server:
                <div>
                    $ ssh -i EdExchange.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-32-59-26.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</kbd>
                </div>


                <div>If the SSH command is successful, the first time you connect, you should see output similar to the following:
                    <pre>
                        The authenticity of host 'ec2-52-32-59-26.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (52.32.59.26)' can't be established.
                        ECDSA key fingerprint is a9:f9:a6:80:69:95:98:6c:d5:38:a1:dc:8b:79:2b:eb.
                        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <div>You should respond with "yes".  If successful, you should now be logged into the server and the command prompt to should look similar to
                    <div><kbd>ubuntu@ip-172-31-42-43:~$</kbd></div>

                    Where the IP address with be the IP address of you server.
                </div>

            </div>
            </p>

            <h2 id="get-software">Step 3b: Get the Network Server Software</h2>


            <div>Download the source code from Github with the following command:</div>
            <div>
                <kbd>$ git clone https://github.com/jhwhetstone/cdsWebserver.git</kbd>
            </div>
            <div>When the command completes, you will have a new directory called "cdsWebserver" (Common Data Services Web Server).
                <div><kbd>$ cd cdsWebserver</kbd></div>
            </div>

            <h2 id="build-software">Step 3c: Build the Network Server Software</h2>

            <div class="ed-title">Step 1: Install Maven</div>
            <div>Maven is a software tool used to compile Java. Install it with the following command</div>

            <div>The recommended way to host a database for the EdExchange network server using Amazon is to use an Amazon RDS
                (Relational Database Service) Postgres instance.  For the purpose of this guide though, you're going to
                use a docker container that will run on the same host as the application server (the reference implementation
                of the network server). In other words, the network server and the network server's database will both be
                running on the same AWS server instance.  This is not the recommended way to configure the system in production.
                Later, you can create an RDS instance and replace the docker container with
                the RDS instance if you choose to use RDS.

            <h1 id="associate-domain-name">Step 4: Associate a Domain Name with the AWS Server</h1>

            <p>In this section, you will associate a domain name, through the Domain Name System (DNS), to a currently running EC2 instance.
                You must be the legal owner of the domain name you
                intend to use for the network server and have access to the registrar so that you can update the domain record
                to point to the new AWS server instance.  The domain name is used in web browser's to locate a particular resource.
                For example, a domain name "edex.phoenix.edu" would allow users
                to access the EdExchange network server on the internet using https://edex.phoenix.edu.  The remainder of this
                section provides instructions on how to configure the domain name to point to the new AWS server using
                Amazon's Route 53 registrar.  In case you haven't registered a domain name yet, the first step covers the registration process.
                If you choose to use Amazon's Route 53 registrar, you can check for domain name availablility on the
                Route 53 dashboard.  You can optionally use any other registrar of your choice. For a list of accredited registrars,
                go to the <a href="https://www.internic.net/alpha.html">Registrar Directory</a>. If you choose a different
                registrar for your domain name, the steps to associate the domain name with the AWS server will be dependent
                on the registrars process. You can optionally transfer the domain name from your registrar to Amazon's Route 53.
                You can access the Route 53 dashboard by selecting "Services/Route 53" from the main AWS dashboard.

                <!--The official Amazon documentation on this process can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/get-a-domain/">here</a>.-->
            </p>

            <div class="ed-title">Register a Domain Name</div>

            <p>
                If you own a domain name registered through a registrar other than Amazon's Route 53, you'll have to follow the instructions specific
                to the registrar for associating the domain name with your AWS server instance.  You can optionally choose to transfer the domain
                name from your current registrar to Amazon's Route 53 registrar and continue following this guide. At a minimum, you will
                need to <a href="#find-ip-address">get the IP address for the Amazon EC2 instance</a>.
                This is the same IP address that was created in the <a href="#assign-static-ip">Assign a Static IP Address</a>.
            </p>


            <p>
                If you don't own a domain name yet for use with EdExchange, you may purchase the domain name through Amazon's
                domain name service, Route 53.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use Route 53, make sure you are currently logged into Amazon and then click <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?region=us-east-1#DomainListing:">here</a>
                to open the Route 53 console in a new window (Route 53 is AWS’s DNS service).
                You can register new domain names with Route 53 as well as manage DNS records for your domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter the desired domain name into the input box and select "Check".  If the domain is available, you
                can add the domain name to your Amazon cart.  In the next step, fill out the required information and purchase the domain name.
                Once you purchase the domain, it will take
                a few minutes for the domain name to become active.  When it becomes active, you should receive an alert on the
                Route 53 Dashboard that indicates the domain registration was successful.  You should also receive an email
                with the same information, sent to the email address you provided during the domain name registration process.
            </p>

                    Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route&nbsp;53 servers in a couple of minutes.
                    In rare circumstances, propagation
                    can take up to 30 minutes. When propagation is done, you'll be able to route traffic to your EC2 instance
                    by using the name of the resource record set that you created in this procedure.

            <h2 id="request-transcript">Step 7: Request a Transcript</h2>

            <p>This section describes how to request a transcript for a test student named "John Doe" from Butte College.  All of the student identifying information is test data,
                and the generated transcript is test data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon completion of this section, you will have sent a PESC transcript request document to Butte College through the CCC Tech Center, which is the service provider
                for Butte College.  In response, a PESC college transcript for the test student will be sent back, and you will have the opportunity to
                view the transcript and information about the transaction.
            </p>
